### Hi there! I'm Eliseu, and I'll talk a bit about myself:
:computer: :skateboard: :beach_umbrella:

:man_student: B.Sc in Information Systems and Specialist in Database Administration, currently I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer.
I like to recognize myself as a young grasshopper in search of new knowledge, new experiences.

:mag_right: I'm really keen on the study of ReactJS, React Native, Node.js, relational and non-relational databases, and agile methodologies.

:camping: In my leisure time, I usually have fun riding a skateboard, watching tv series, and exploring new places with awesome landscapes.
I consider myself an unforgettable moment explorer.

:mailbox: Let's talk about technology, get in touch:
